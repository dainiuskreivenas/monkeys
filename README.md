# Monkey and Banana Problem

The monkey and banana problems is a famous toy problem in artificial intelligence, particularly in logic programming and planning. 

A monkey is in a room. Suspended from the ceiling is a bunch of bananas, beyond the monkey's reach. However, in the room there are also a chair and a stick. The ceiling is just the right height so that a monkey standing on a chair could knock the bananas down with the stick. The monkey knows how to move around, carry other things around, reach for the bananas.
